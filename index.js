const users = require('./users.json') // if you get a "Cannot find module './users.json'" then run npm run setup to generate the user data

// practice .forEach, .map, and .filter

// print out all users' first names

// print out all users' full names

// create a new array with just the full names

// create a new array with only the users who have 3 or more friends

// create a new array with only the users who can vote (18 or older)

// create a new array with only the users who have a gmail email

// create a new array populated with objects that just contain a users firstName, lastName, and birthdate

// Bonus: create a new set with all the unique states the users live in. if a state appears more than once in the data, it should still only appear once in the set

// Bonus: create a map (key value pair) with all the states as the keys and the number of times that state appears in the dataset as the value.
