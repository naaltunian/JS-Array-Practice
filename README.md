# JS Array Iterator Practice

## Description
This repository is for people to practice the basics of Array iterator functions such as `.forEach`, `.map`, and `.filter`. Over time I'll add in others. It is important to utilzie the documentation available at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), Stack Overflow, and other resources to help solve these basic probblems.

### Setup
Run `npm install` and then `npm run setup` to create the fake data used to practice. You can view that generated data in `users.json`.
